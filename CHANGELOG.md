## Release 0.1.2 (2015-11-20)

```
Baseline: ee0ade3
   + 1e66ccd: RELNOTES: Symlink dirents of directories containing a
              file named
              "DONT_FOLLOW_SYMLINKS_WHEN_TRAVERSING_THIS_DIRECTORY_VIA
              _A_RECURSIVE_TARGET_PATTERN" will *not* be traversed
              for transitive target patterns. The motivation here is
              to allow directories that intentionally contain wonky
              symlinks (e.g. foo/bar -> foo) to opt out of being
              consumed by Blaze. For example, given
   + f5773fc: Set the ijar MAX_BUFFER_SIZE to 256 MB
```

New features:

  - java_library now supports the proguard_specs attribute for
    passing Proguard configuration up to Android (not Java) binaries.
  - http_file can specify "executable" to make the downloaded file
    runnable.
  - Debian and tar packaging is now supported
    (see tools/build_defs/pkg/README.md).
  - cpxx_builtin_include_directory specifications allow more
    flexibility.
  - accept %crosstool_top% in cxx_builtin_include_directory
  - android_binary now supports proguard_apply_mapping to re-use a
    previously generated proguard mapping.

Important changes:

  - remove webstatusserver (--use_webstatusserver).
  - Add support for objc textual headers, which will not be compiled
    when modules are enabled.
  - actoolzip, momczip and swiftstdlibtoolzip have all been made into
    bash scripts and have been renamed to actoolwrapper, momcwrapper
    and swiftstdlibtoolwrapper respectively. The old versions will be
    deleted in a later change.
  - [rust] Add rust_bench_test and rust_doc_test rules and improve
    usability of rust_test tule.
  - Java rules now support a resource_strip_prefix attribute that
    allows the removal of path prefixes from Java resources.
  - [docker_build] incremental loading is default now.
    Specify explicitly //package:target.tar (with the .tar extension)
    to obtain the full image.
  - --ios_signing_cert_name allows specifying a cert for iOS app
    signing
  - Go rules for Bazel.
  - [jsonnet] Update to Jsonnet 0.8.1.
  - [jsonnet] Add vars and code_vars attributes to jsonnet_to_json to
    allow passing external variables to Jsonnet via --var and
    --code_var.
  - Adds --override_workspace_root blaze flag to hand-set
    workspace_root and mainGroup in xcodeproj.
  - Allow dots in package names.
  - When used as a forwarding rule (i.e., has no sources),
    android_library
    will also forward any exported_plugins in its dependencies.
  - Add support for Windows-created zip files with non-posix
    permissions.
  - [jsonnet] Add jsonnet_to_json_test rule for testing Jsonnet code.
  - C++ compile actions run in a sandbox now on systems that support
    sandboxed execution.
  - The names of the clang compilers in the Android NDK crosstool no
    longer reference gcc.
  - 420 dpi is now a valid density for andoid_binary.densities.
  - Bazel does strict validation of include files now to ensure
    correct incremental builds. If you see compilation errors when
    building C++ code, please make sure that you explicitly declare
    all header files in the srcs or hdrs attribute of your cc_*
    targets and that your cc_* targets have correct "deps" on
    cc_library's that they use.
  - [jsonnet] Fix jsonnet_to_json rule to read code_vars from
    code_vars instead of vars.
  - Tests, genrules, and Skylark actions without the
    "requires-network" tag will no longer be able to access the
    network.
  - C++ libraries no longer need includes = ["."] (or similar copts)
    to include paths relative to a remote repository's root.
  - Support exports attribute for android_library
  - Symlink dirents of directories containing a file named
    "DONT_FOLLOW_SYMLINKS_WHEN_TRAVERSING_THIS_DIRECTORY_VIA_A_RECURSI
    VE_TARGET_PATTERN" will *not* be traversed for transitive target
    patterns. The motivation here is to allow directories that
    intentionally contain wonky symlinks (e.g. foo/bar -> foo) to opt
    out of being consumed by Blaze.

## Release 0.1.1 (2015-10-05)

```
Baseline: 22616ae
   + 1ef338f: Rollback of "Propagates cc_library linkopts attribute
              to dependent objc_libraries.": breaks certain
              objc_binary build targets.
   + 5fb1073: Reintroduce an inconsistency check (albeit, in a weaker
              form) removed by a previous change that was trying to
              optimize away a filesystem call.
   + 6d00468b2eb976866cfb814d562e0d53a580a46f: Add IdlClass to the embedded default android tools
              repository and rearrange BuildJar's JarHelper so that
              it too can be embedded.
   + a5199039934a2e399a7201adc0d74e2f2d2b0ff3: Fixes Android integration tests by wiring up idlclass
              rules in integration environment.
```

Incompatible changes:

  - Bazel requires JDK 8 to run.
  - Attribute "copts" is removed from j2objc_library.

New features:

  - a cc_binary rule may list '.s' and '.asm' files in the srcs
  - Support for build with libsass.
  - labels in "linkopts" may match any label in either "deps" or
    "srcs" to be considered valid.
  - Maven servers that require username & password authentication are
    now supported (see maven_server documentation).

Important changes:

  - Support empty plist files
  - The <compatible-screens> section of the AndroidManifest.xml will
    not be overwritten if it already contains a <screen> tag for each
    of the densities specified on the android_binary rule.
  - Add Jsonnet rules to Bazel
  - Remove deprecated xcode_options flag.
  - Workspace names are now restricted to being in their base
    directory
    (that is, the names cannot contain up-level references or /./).
  - j2objc_library on Bazel now transpiles transitive proto_library
    dependencies. (Note that java_* rules in Bazel do not yet support
    protos; currently they ignore proto dependencies.)
  - new_http_archive can specify a root directory.
  - Adds support for dylibs on devices for Xcode 7.
  - [d] d_docs rules now depend on a d_binary, a d_library or
    d_source_library.
  - [docker] docker_build now set the permission to 0555 to files
    added to the layer, use `mode = "0644"` to use the legacy behavior.
  - android_binary now has a main_dex_proguard_specs attribute to
    specify which classes should be in the main dex.
  - [rust] Add rust_docs rule for generating rustdoc.
## Release 0.1.0 (2015-09-08)

   + 4e21d90: Remove BUILD.glob and incorporate the necessary
